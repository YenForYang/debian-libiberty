Description: library of utility functions used by GNU programs
 The libib library is a collection of subroutines used by various
 GNU programs, which are missing or broken on some systems.

 This library shouldn't be used by other software, but unfortunately
 already is. There is no guaranty for a stable library API, and no
 shared library is provided.
